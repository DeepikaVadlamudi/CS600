# CS600
##  Advanced Algorithms

A collection of few algorithms from the course CS600 Advance Algorithms coded in Python. 

## Usage
To use the code:
 - download the latest version from python.org
 - Set up a text editor or IDE. I have used Atom but if you don't have a text editore like Atom, VS studio, or PyCharm already setup,
   I would suggest ypu go with Sublime Text. (Although PyCharm is nicer if you have space to spare).
 - Use cmd (or Terminal for MacOS) to navigate to the directory and run the script.
 
_Also following YouTube video lectures by Srini Devdas and Erik Demaine to get a thorough understanding of the course._
